Repo doesn't require any build steps

Instead, it has a slick HTML + Gulp setup which compiles `script` tags and such which are delimited by `<!--` comments

`svgcanvas.js` seems to be pretty important
After searching around, this is part of https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit
so that might be a better starting point for us

Though this repo prob highlights how to leverage their setup

So many parts...
`method-draw.js#Editor.init` is where all our hooks get started (e.g. add a `return` before `$.SvgCanvas` and see how empty it is

Going to try ditching HTML content now, see what happens

App is started via `$(methodDraw.init)` in footer of `method-draw.js`
